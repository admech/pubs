abstract = {Contact processes may be represented by local discretization, by a rigid body approach or by a mixed method using both ideas. For the dynamics of mechanical systems a rigid body approach is described achieving good results also for multiple contact problems. This paper considers mainly contacts in multi-body systems where the corresponding contact constraints vary with time thus generating structure-variant systems. The equations of motion for dynamical systems with such an unilateral behavior are discussed, solution methods and applications are presented.},

abstract = {Mobile robots are more and more commonly used for everyday automated transportation and logistics tasks; they carry goods, parts and even people. When maneuvers in cluttered environments are executed with expensive loads the need for reliable, safe and efficient movement is paramount. This dissertation is written with the goal of solving some problems related to a special class of mobile transport robots. Omnidirectional wheels are well known in the robotics community, their exceptional maneuvering capabilities attract a lot of robot builders and several industrial applications are known as well. To fully exploit the advantages of these special wheels sophisticated mechanics and control methods are required. Since modern engineering uses simulation wherever possible, to eliminate design errors early in the development, the first objective of my research was to create an easy to use, yet realistic model in simulation for the general omnidirectional wheel. To create this model I used empirical tire models created for automotive simulation – to make advantage of the knowledge accumulated in this domain – and modified them to generate forces like an omnidirectional wheel, in essence transforming the longitudinal force component in the direction of the rollers. I created two embodiments as an example in Dymola environment and verified their functionality using kinematic equations and simple lumped robot models. Omnidirectional wheels have no side-force generating capabilities, this is the very attribute that allows them to generate holonomic movement. Due to this characteristic omnidirectional platforms do not keep their direction of movement when braked intensively, instead they tend to swerve around the most loaded wheel. My second goal was to try and eliminate the swerving effect when braking. The braking problem involves a nonlinear MIMO system with uncertain parameters, since for example the ground-wheel contact depends nonlinearly on the unknown wheel load, ground and wheel material characteristics. I created a sliding mode controller that takes wheel center velocity vectors as input and actuates the brakes according to the given wheels' capability to reduce unwanted platform motion i.e. swerving. I also incorporated a factor to tune braking distance. I verified the performance of the controller in simulation, it showed high tolerance against structured and unstructured uncertainties in the platform model. The control law only uses knowledge on the kinematics of the robot, yet it works well with robots with dynamic properties. To be able to control an omnidirectional platform, feedback of the motion is essential. Due to the special movement, traditional, wheel rotation based methods are highly inaccurate; therefore I directed my research towards optical feedback, using an image detector facing the ground and correlation. The method itself is not new most people know it from optical mice. There are many similar solutions in the literature, but they are not suited to movements up to several tens of m/s. To enhance the range of the sensor I investigated the possibility of using line scan cameras. They offer high speed and resolution in a single dimension. To verify whether movements off the main axis make measurements impossible I created a simulator in Matlab and made several experiments with a virtual sensor. My results show that by careful choice of parameters and processing, a line scan camera can be made insensitive to off axis movements and high speed one dimensional measurement is possible while moving in two dimensions. The results of my research were evaluated in simulation and an early prototype of the speed sensor was incorporated in student projects.},

abstract = {Mecanum wheels are used when omnidirectional movability of a vehicle is desired. That means that the vehicle can move along a prescribed path and at the same time rotate arbitrarily around its center. A Mecanum wheel consists of a set of rolls arranged around the wheel axis. In this paper we describe in detail the geometry of these rolls. We derive simple canonical parameterizations of the roll generating curve and the roll surface itself. These parametric representations reveal the geometry of the roll. With their help we can easily find an approximation of the roll surface by a torus for manufacture purposes. Based on the roll parametrization we study the kinematics of a vehicle featured with Mecanum wheels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An algorithm for constructing elementary maneuvers (gaits) providing the transition from one steady-state motion to another is presented for the dynamic model.

@article{Kosenko1998,
abstract = {A dynamical system is constructed in the multiplicative group of the quarternion algebra H that serves as the configuration space. A homomorphism H → SO(3) is used such that the unit sphere S3⊂ H, invariant under the system, is transformed into the rotation group SO(3). The homomorphic image of the system is identical with the dynamics of rotational motion of a rigid body. The equations of motion are completely integrated in the Euler case. To this end Weierstrass' elliptic functions are used. The following goals are achieved within the framework of the method: (a) when representing the algorithms for modelling the dynamics it suffices to use only one chart from the atlas of the phase space manifold, (b) the point in the configuration space of the actual motion lies on the unit sphere, which ensures the best accuracy in numerical procedures, and (c) in the majority of applications the right-hand sides of the equations of perturbed motion depend polynomially on the phase variables, which simplifies the use of computer algebra in analytic theories. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This study addresses the problem of controlling an omni-directional vehicle with both state and control dependent constraints. The task of the vehicle is to attain its desired final position given in the task space. The control constraints resulting from the physical abilities of actuators driving the vehicle wheels are also taken into account during the robot movement. The problem of collision avoidance is solved here based on an exterior penalty function approach which results in smooth vehicle velocities near obstacles. Provided that, a solution to the aforementioned vehicle task exists, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to derive the control scheme. The numerical simulation results carried out for the omni-directional vehicle operating in both a constraint-free task space and task space including obstacles, illustrate the performance of the proposed controllers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mobile robots equipped with four Mecanum wheels have the omnidirectional property, which means, they have the ability to move instantaneously in any direction, from any configuration. Therefore, compared to conventional platforms, these vehicles possess multiple advantages in terms of their mobility in narrow spaces or crowded environments. They have the ability to easily perform certain tasks in congested environments foreseen with static obstacles, dynamic obstacles or narrow areas. Usually, such environments are found in factory workshops, warehouses, hospitals, etc. Hence the resulting needs to create this kind of robotic platforms to satisfy the requirements of various fields, such as: industrial, military, naval, medical and last but not least, the educational field (as the basis for research). The characteristics of the Mecanum wheel, a short comparison between this type of wheel and a conventional wheel, as well as the constructive and design solutions previously developed are described in the first part of this paper. Then, some application fields and the related systems based on Mecanum wheel are presented.},

For this initially, dynamics of the free roller moving in field of gravity and having a unilateral contact constraint with horizontal rigid surface is modeled. The contact tracking algorithm for the roller turns out to be extremely simple and efficient. On the next layer of the model structure the omni wheel model is developed and debugged. Finally, the whole vehicle model is assembled as a container class having arrays of objects as instantiated classes really being models of omni wheels and joints. Dynamical properties of the resulting model are illustrated via numerical experiments.

Passive rollers are fastened along the rim of each wheel, enabling each wheel not only to roll in the usual manner, but also to move perpendicular to its plane. Each of these wheels, as well as the ordinary wheels, is equipped with one drive, which rotates the wheel about its axis. The vehicle equipped with roller-carrying wheels can move in any direction with any orientation. The motion of the robot on a horizontal surface is studied in the case where the centre of mass of the robot deviates from the geometric centre of the triangular platform, and there is no slip at the points of contact of the rollers with the supporting surface. In the case of free motion of the robot, an additional first integral is pointed out and the exact solution found is analysed. An equation for specifying steady motions, under which a constant voltage is supplied to the DC motors that drive the wheels, is constructed. The stability of the rectilinear motion of the robot is investigated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An approach to the dynamics of mechanical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, involving unilateral constraints, is developed. In the n-dimensional linear spaces of forces and velocities, some classical concepts of Convex Analysis are used, but no convexity assumption is made concerning the constraint inequalities. The velocity is not supposed to be a differentiable function of time, but only to have locally bounded variation, so the role of the acceleration is held by a n-dimensional measure on the considered time interval. Dynamics is then governed by measure differential inclusions, which treat possible velocity jumps on the same footing as smooth motions. Possible collisions are described as soft, thus dissipative. Friction is taken into account under a recently proposed expression of Coulomb's law. These formulations have the advantage of generating numerical algorithms of time-discretization, able to handle, in particular, the nonsmooth effects arising from unilaterality and from dry friction.},

abstract = {An impact model for two-dimensional contact situations is developed which contains the main physical effects of a compliance element in the normal direction and a series of a compliance and Coulomb friction elements in the tangential direction. For systems with multiple impacts a unilateral formulation based on Poisson's hypothesis is used to describe the impulses which are transferred in the normal direction. The event of an impact is divided into two phases. The phase of compression ends with vanishing approaching velocity if normal impulses are transferred and is equivalent to a completely inelastic collision. The phase of expansion allows the bodies to separate under the action of the normal impulses whenever they are large enough. The absolute values of the tangential impulses are bounded by the magnitudes of the normal impulses, due to the Coulomb friction relationship on the impulse level. One part of the transferred tangential impulse during compression is assumed to be partly reversible which may be regarded as an application of Poisson's law. The remaining part is completely irreversible and considered friction. This formulation contains the special case of completely elastic tangential impacts as well as the situation when only Coulomb friction acts. It is proven that the presented impact model is always dissipative or energy preserving. The evaluation of the problem is done by solving one set of complementarity conditions during compression and a nearly identical set of equations during expansion. The theory is applied to some basic examples which demonstrate the difference between Newton's and Poisson's hypotheses.},

Base dynamical abstractions, classes, are described which provide a model building using object-oriented paradigm for the design of dynamic objects virtual prototypes. Contact tracking block is the most important one of any algorithm for simulation the mechanical contact. This block provides permanent computations of the contact point/patch where the process of bodies mechanical interaction takes place. A general formulation of contact in algebraic and/or differential forms is under analysis. The omni directional wheel dynamical testbench is under construction then. This model is built in a way such that the wheel disc equipped by rollers along its rim keeps its vertical orientation permanently. Such an arrangement of the virtual testbench provides indeed the simulation of the wheel motion like it is a part of any virtual omni vehicle. Using the omni wheel permanent vertical orientation we are able to build up an efficient algorithm for contact tracking between the roller and the floor. The case of so-called angled (being preliminarily rotated) rollers is also included. The angle of roller inclination to the wheel plane is possible to be varied, as a parameter of the dynamical problem, in frame of wide range of its values. This approach is a natural generalization of its previous version which was implemented for the case of zero angle of the roller prerotation.},

This is caused by the free rolling rollers around the circumference, the very same thing that allows holonomic movement. An interesting consequence is that when an omnidirectional platform undergoes heavy braking, due to uneven wheel load or other disturbances, the vehicle has a tendency to swerve. An omnidirectional platform is a complex nonlinear system, where the nonlinearities come from the wheel material and construction, and the unidirectional force generation capability. In this article a corrective controller is described that prevents swerving even in the presence of high uncertainties. The operation and disturbance rejection of the controller is demonstrated by simulation in Modelica-Dymola environment.},

The model was applied to control a kiwi drive mobile robot and validated by experimental measurements.

abstract = {In couplings of machines and mechanisms, backlash and friction phenomena are always occurring. Whether stick-slip phenomena take place depends on the structure of such couplings. These processes can be modeled as multibody systems with a time-varying topology. Making use of Lagrange multiplier methods with a mathematical formulation of the contact problem is very efficient for large systems with many constraints. The differential-algebraic equations of a system are transformed into a resolvable mathematical form by means of contact laws. In the following, rigid multibody systems with dependent constraints and planar friction will be considered. For the evaluation of such problems, an iterative algorithm is presented. This method is based on transformations of the kinematic secondary conditions in the form of inequalities to equations. In mathematical sense, these transformations are projections of the constraint forces on convex sets. Ultimately, we have a solvable nonlinear system of equations consisting of the differential equations of motion, the constraint equations and the projections of the constraint forces.},

abstract = {The motion of an omni-mobile vehicle on a horizontal plane is considered. The wheels are modelled by absolutely rigid discs. Slippage in a certain direction, which makes a constant non- zero angle with the plane of a disc, is possible at the contact point of a wheel and the plane, and the planes of the discs are fixed with respect to the platform of the vehicle. The dynamic equations of motion are obtained for vehicles of this type with an arbitrary number and arrangement of the wheels. A complete qualitative description of the inertial motion of a vehicle is given (there are no control actions and it is assumed that there is no friction in the axes). The result is presented in the form of a phase portrait of the system. The motion of a vehicle is then considered in the case when control moments are applied to the axes of the wheels. The stability and branching of a certain class of steady motions of the vehicle are investigated. The domain of parameters is separated out where Andronov-Hopf bifurcation occurs with the formation of unstable limit cycles. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Omni-drive systems operate by having individual wheels apply torque in one direction in the same way as a regular wheel, but are able to slide freely in another direction (often perpendicular to the torque vector). The key advantage of omni-drive systems is that translational and rotational motion are decoupled for simple motion. However, in considering the fastest possible motion this is not necessarily the case. In this paper, we review all the current popular designs of omni-drive transport systems, and compare them in terms of practical and theoretical considerations. We then present a kinematic analysis that applies to two major omni-drive robot vehicles classes, for any number of wheels.

abstract = {This paper presents a new type of omnidirectional and holonomic mobile platform with a four-wheel-drive (4WD) mechanism for improving traction of electric wheelchairs on slippery surfaces and enhancing mobility on rough terrain. The 4WD mechanism includes a pair of normal wheels on the rear and a pair of omniwheels on the front. The normal wheel in rear and the omniwheel in front on the same side of the drive mechanism are connected by a power transmission to rotate in unison with a common motor. Omniwheels enable the front of the mechanism to roll freely from side to side. A third motor turns the chair about a vertical axis at the center of the mobile platform Thus the platform is controlled by three motors, no redundancy and no motor confliction are found on the drive system High step climb capability of the 4WD mechanism solves the insufficient mobility problem and the omnidirectional control enables simple and easy operation with no complicated maneuvering. To verify the availability of the proposed mobile system for wheelchairs, a prototype is designed and built. The fundamental step climb capability and holonomic and omnidirectional mobility are verified by a series of experiments.},

abstract = {Mobile robots have been an essential element of space exploration to perform science on distant lunar and planetary objects. Past orbiter missions to Moon have shown evidence on the presence of ice inside the permanently shadowed polar areas. Similarly, Mars holds clues of life in the distant past. While data sent by orbiters provides a wealth of information and gives rise to new speculations and theories, in-situ science data from mobile rovers and landers is essential to validate or confirm them. “Mobility” is a vital element for a space missions due to valuable science return potential from different sites as opposed to static landers. Over the years, technology development has given rise to numerous mobile systems. Some of the systems are spin-offs from terrestrial applications like automobiles that use wheels, military tanks that use tracks and aerial balloons. Others have been developed purely for space application like hoppers and hybrid systems. Since 1970s, twelve surface missions have reported using mobile robots. Most of them used wheels as their mobility element for locomotion. Since surface space-exploration of planetary objects across the solar system has gained increasing importance in recent years, it is important to understand the state-of-the-art in mobile robotics and the technology development of the mobility system in particular. This need will be addressed in this chapter.},

abstract = {Conventional training simulators commonly use the hexapod configuration to provide motion cues. While widely used, studies have shown that hexapods are incapable of producing the range of motion required to achieve high fidelity simulation required in many applications. Atlas is a six degree of freedom vehicle operating training simulator motion platform where orienting is decoupled from positioning, and unbounded rotation is possible about any axis. Angular displacements are achieved by manipulating the cockpit contained in a 2.9 metre (9.5 foot) diameter sphere with three Mecanum wheel actuators. The angular velocity Jacobian, J$\omega$, maps the desired angular velocity of the sphere to the required speeds of the three Mecanum wheels, while the static force Jacobian, J$\tau$ , maps the static moment vector required to statically orient the sphere to the static torques required by the three Mecanum wheels. In this paper, the two Jacobians are derived independently, and it is confirmed that J$\omega$ D JT $\tau$, as it must. The implications on the required normal forces at the interface between the sphere and three Mecanum wheel contact patches are discussed.},

Each roller have an axis of rotation at 45° to the plane of the wheel and at 45° to a line through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel. A typical configuration is the four-wheeled multi-directional mobile robot platform. By alternating wheels with left and right handed rollers, in such a way that each wheel applies force roughly at right angles to the wheelbase diagonally, the vehicle is stable and can be made to move in any direction. The present work is to develop a mecanum wheel based robot platform for industrial applications which is equipped with the Infrared (IR) sensor to detect the obstacle around it and move accordingly and also to transfer the material from one place to another place. Mostly such type of robot platform is used in the warehouse automation.},

It turned out that a simplified and efficient algorithm for contact tracking is possible. On the next stage the omniwheel model is implemented. After that the whole vehicle model is assembled as a container class having arrays of objects as instantiated classes/models of omniwheels and joints.
